No matter what type of vaccine you have, they’re all attempting to offer the immune system a preview of the virus, without any of the destructive power of the real coronavirus.</p><p>So which paper tiger is most likely to beat COVID-19?</p><a name="markSCROLLOUTtrueSCROLLOUTTOPtrueKEYfourteen"> </a><h2>Option one: The whole virus</h2><h3>The old-school approach that carries a bit of risk</h3><p>Traditionally, vaccines have offered the body a preview of a virus by injecting a copy of the whole virus that's either massively weaker ("live attenuated vaccine") or killed ("inactivated" vaccine). Let's call these approaches 'Coronavirus Lite' — like light beer, it's still alcohol, but a little bit of it won't mess you up. </p><p>Just two of the 14 coronavirus <a href="https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/">vaccine candidates in human trials</a> use these old-school approaches, because they hold some drawbacks.</p><p>A live attenuated (weakened) vaccine has the potential to go rogue inside the body and "revert" to full strength. This is <em>extremely</em> rare. But it's what has caused vaccine-derived outbreaks of polio that are <a href="http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/17th-IMB-report-20191115.pdf">spreading uncontrolled across West Africa</a> right now.</p><p>What's more, live attenuated vaccines often aren't <a href="https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccination-for-special-risk-groups/vaccination-for-people-who-are-immunocompromised">given to people with highly compromised immune systems</a> as they may not be able to fight even a very weak copy of the virus. These are, of course, the very same people most at risk from coronavirus.</p><p>Inactivated vaccines are much safer because the virus is completely dead. A good example is your annual flu shot, which all starts with a vast sea of chicken eggs.</p><p>Yes… chicken eggs.</p><p>The flu virus is grown inside eggs because it can't reproduce unless it's in an environment where it can take over cells. And it turns out a simple egg provides the perfect, contained environment for that to happen.</p><p>But growing a virus inside thousands upon thousands of chicken eggs is an expensive process that takes months. And as you can imagine, a giant warehouse full of deadly virus isn't an OHS dream. </p><p>So why would we use this old-school technology?</p><a name="markKEYfifteenSCROLLOUTtrueSCROLLOUTBOTTOMtrue"> </a><p>Well, because the immune system is spotting a whole virus, it takes it very seriously.</p><p>The live but weakened vaccines can produce a super strong immune response that for some pathogens can last a lifetime without the need for booster shots — they're usually the ones you get as a child, like the measles, mumps and rubella shot.</p><p>Plus, researchers are starting to question whether live vaccines could actually be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-vaccine-innate-immunity.html">boosting your immune system across the board</a>, like a kind of wonder-shot that supercharges your ability to fight bugs.</p><p>And this is the theory behind what went into Dr Jennens' arm, one of the first vaccines to be trialled for coronavirus, here in our own backyard.</p><figure class="embed-content">

</figure><p> </p><p>Over the years, health workers noticed that children in developing countries who received the BCG tuberculosis vaccine died less than other kids — and not just from TB.</p><p>Research has <a href="https://theconversation.com/could-bcg-a-100-year-old-vaccine-for-tuberculosis-protect-against-coronavirus-138006" target="_self" title="">since confirmed that the vaccine protects</a> against a number of diseases, and so 4,000 Australian health workers like Dr Jennens have put their hands up to test whether this coronavirus is one of them.</p><p>"I was happy to play a small part in this worldwide effort", says Dr Jennens of joining the international <a href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/BRACE" target="_self" title="">"BRACE" trial</a>. </p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>"If it's effective, I would feel safer going to work and caring for my patients."</p></blockquote><p>Being a century old, the safety of the BCG vaccine is long established, which could save a lot of time in testing. </p><p>But there's no guarantee it will offer enough protection, if any, against the coronavirus.</p><p>Enter, the new-school approach.</p><h2>Option two: just a bit of the virus</h2><h3><strong>The new-school approach — that takes a while to get right</strong></h3><p>What if, instead of previewing the whole virus, we could just show the immune system a bit of the virus — enough for it to recognise the real invader when it arrives?</p><p>It's a bit like when you see a police sketch of a criminal on the run - it's not a full likeness, but you get a sense of who you're looking out for.</p><p>Scientists nowadays are creating a preview using a fragment of the virus (a "sub-unit")  — whether that's a lone protein or an empty shell with no bad genes inside.</p><p>Because it's just a bit of the virus, not the full thing, it can't go rogue. "There is very little risk of safety issues arising," says virologist Dr Lisa Sedger from UTS.</p><a name="markKEYsixteen"> </a><p>For this kind of vaccine, you want to give the body a preview of part of the virus that triggers the immune response in the body (an "antigen"). With the coronavirus, the spike protein is a good option.</p><a name="remove"> </a><img src="/cm/lb/12349358/data/fallback13-data.jpg" alt="" title=""  width="800" height="800" /><p> </p><a name="endremove"> </a><a name="mark"> </a><p>Scientists grow this protein by inserting its DNA into the DNA of a microbe like yeast, a process called "recombination". Yeast is able to grow the virus proteins very quickly and on an industrial scale.</p><a name="markKEYseventeen"> </a><p>The isolated protein is then injected into the body with an "adjuvant" — a chemical that sends a danger signal to get the immune system to notice the intruder.</p><a name="remove"> </a><img src="/cm/lb/12349360/data/fallback14-data.jpg" alt="" title=""  width="800" height="800" /><p> </p><a name="endremove"> </a><a name="markKEYeighteen"> </a><p>In a successful vaccine, the body will mount a strong immune response, releasing antibodies that neutralise the spike, and memory cells that patrol your body going forward.</p><a name="remove"> </a><img src="/cm/lb/12349364/data/fallback15-data.jpg" alt="" title=""  width="800" height="800" /><p> </p><a name="endremove"> </a><a name="markSCROLLOUTtrueSCROLLOUTTOPtrueKEYeighteen"> </a><p>It's not so much the spike protein itself but its pairing with the adjuvant that RMIT vaccine expert Dr Kylie Quinn says is "pretty cool". </p><p>Adjuvants are quite literally the industry's "dirty little secret" — they came about when researchers noticed that early vaccines from slightly contaminated test tubes were more effective.

But those people who are infected are producing less virus and transmitting to fewer people and disease severity is reduced. So it still reduces the burden on the healthcare system."</p><p>But as Dr Collignon says, "You're not able to control the disease with partial protection - you'd need to keep doing the additional measures on top". <br/> </p><h2>From lab to jab</h2><p>We might think that finding a vaccine that's safe and effective is the challenge. But that's just the beginning.</p><p>The real bottleneck, says Dr Quinn, will be "building the infrastructure" for billions of doses.</p><p>Almost daily, companies are announcing supply deals for their yet to be proven vaccines, like Johnson and Johnson's <a href="https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/the-road-to-covid-19-vaccine-live-video-series">"commitment to supply one billion doses"</a> of the vaccine it does not yet have.<br/> </p><p>Bill Gates has put his hand up to lose "a few billion dollars" building factories for the seven most promising vaccine candidates, estimating that about five of them will go unused. "It's worth it", he said. </p><p>It's an expensive gamble that could crash and burn - or unlock the global economy.</p><p>But who gets those early doses? There's a risk that vaccine distribution could end up like the fight for ventilators, masks and gloves, somewhat like toilet-paper-gate on the global stage.<br/> </p><p>The vaccine candidates that <a href="https://vac-lshtm.shinyapps.io/ncov_vaccine_landscape/">first reached human trials</a> emerged from the US, whose foreign policy slogan is "America First", and Chinese state-run firms.</p><p>In an early sign of what's to come, President Trump blocked a shipment of medical equipment from reaching Germany in March, which the German government called "modern piracy", before <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-coronavirus-vaccine-germany-curevac/">attempting to take over</a> the promising German vaccine firm CureVac.</p><p>China has been showering struggling countries with coronavirus aid, which has been described as "mask diplomacy".</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>If a vaccine were to become a "get out of jail free" card for China, how might that play out in distribution?</p></blockquote><p>Governments are still haunted by the swine flu vaccine, which <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-18/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-race-swine-flu-pandemic-lessons/12243580" target="_self" title="">wealthy countries including Australia effectively hoarded</a>. Some 36 million doses ordered by the US but produced in Australia were seized by our government - a scenario that could easily happen again.</p><p>Dr Komesaroff hopes we can avoid repeating the HIV crisis, where life-saving drugs were funnelled to "those in New York who could afford it" while in some African countries, the life expectancy halved.<br/> </p><p>"With HIV, it was easy for wealthy countries to remain comfortable, but if COVID-19 becomes widely disseminated in Africa and Asia, including Indonesia, which is of particular relevance for Australia, there will be risks to the rest of the world."</p><h2>The best shot we'll get</h2><p>Mention "the coronavirus vaccine" and you'll be swiftly reprimanded by Dr Collignon - "it's not 'when' the coronavirus vaccine, it's a big 'if'".</p><p>But the experts agree the scientific community has never worked like this before.</p><p>"The way we do science has completely changed," says Dr Quinn.</p><p>"The way we normally distribute information is through publication which can take years. Now, the pre-print services mean there's no delay."</p><p>Then there's the millions being poured into experimental fields like genetic vaccines that could be applied far beyond infectious disease.</p><blockquote class="quote--pullquote"><p>Perhaps in five years, Dr Jennens won't be putting his arm forward to receive a coronavirus vaccine, but administering a cancer vaccine.</p></blockquote><figure class="embed-content">
